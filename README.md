Assignments for CSCI111


Lab 1: Create a sketch that draws a well-known cartoon character (a Simpsons character, Disney character, whatever). The character should be recognizable, but need not be perfect. You are required to use at least one circle/ellipse, one rectangle, one triangle, and some lines. You are also required to use at least three different colors for stroke, fill, and background.
Lab 2: Create a program that “rains cats and dogs.” In other words, draw some shapes that look like cats, and some that look like dogs, and animate them so that they fall down the screen, at a slight angle to the right (there is a slight wind). You must have at least 2 cats and 2 dogs (but they can be the same combinations of shapes, but cats must look different than dogs), plus appropriate use of color. The cats/dogs must be scattered, not lined up together. Use the modulo (%) operator so that they “wrap around” to the top after they fall past the bottom of the screen.
Lab 3: Create a program that shows three boxes, and changes the hue of each box (to a random hue) when the user clicks the box or types the box’s number.
Lab 4: Your task is to use for() loops and shapes and colors to recreate one of the following textures. You must recreate it exactly (within a few pixels); use the colors specified. Patterns: http://csci111.artifice.cc/labs/2014-09-20-lab-4.html
Group Project 1: Make a simple game with at least one keyPressed function, one mousePressed function, three difficulties, a way to keep score.
Lab 5: Take your game project and add functions. You don’t have to improve the game, but you do need at least three functions (besides setup, draw, keyPressed, etc.)
Lab 6: Create some “classes” for an object-oriented version of the Pong game.
Lab 7: Create a program that shows an image that you can translate, rotate, and zoom in/out. Include a "reset" function that resets the image to original form when 'R' is pressed.
Lab 8: Write four functions. You are only allowed to use rect() once in each function. Instructions explained: http://csci111.artifice.cc/labs/2014-11-12-lab-8.html
Group Project 2: Create a bigger, larger game. You may extend your first group project game, but only if it is a substantial extension. You are not allowed to create Pong. There are too many Pong solutions online. You do not need to use a physics engine.
